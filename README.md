### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Machine Learning project for recognising animal's types.

The dataset used for training the model is already available at Kaggle, and can be downloaded on the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10).

Several models were trained and tested before deciding which one gives the best prediction. The results showed that the
more epochs were set, the better the prediction was. Apart from the model structure and the epochs, the batch size was
the parameter which was experimented with as well. After the model finishes with the training and the validation on the
dataset, it is ready to make some predictions on the test set it is provided. The predictions were with 87.5% accuracy,
meaning it correctly guessed 14 our of 16 photographs.
